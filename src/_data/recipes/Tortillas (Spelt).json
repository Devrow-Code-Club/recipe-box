Then take the rolling pin and roll from the center outwards, back and forth a few times as you go around the circle.  When it starts to get thinner, take your left hand (if you're right handed) and turn the tortilla a couple inches.  Use your right hand to use the rolling pin (holding in the middle) and roll from the center outwards.  Keep turning and rolling until it is paper thin.",
    "Preheat a skillet on medium high heat.",
    "Place a tortilla into the skillet and watch until bubbles form.  This won't take long.",
    "After bubbles form, and the bottom is lightly brown (or there are darker spots), flip over, press down once or twice, and cook for about 30-45 seconds, or if smoke appears.",
    "Cook remaining tortillas, watching carefully, and place in a plastic bag, with wet paper towels in between them (or at least on top and bottom of stack) to keep them soft and moist.",
    "Refrigerate for later or remove the paper towels and freeze."
